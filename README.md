# Julia-university-course

University courses are notoriously very slow at keeping up with cutting edge languages and technologies. This course aims to cover the lack of Julia university courses around the internet. The structure of the course takes inspiration from university syllabi on Python, C, etc., around the world. It is organized in weeks on the UK University model, every week contains learning material, problems, and solutions.

~Good Julia to everyone!~
